## 10 Universal Skills that are Hard to Learn, but will Pay Off Forever

**1. Develop a High Pain Tolerance - Elon Musk**  
A friend of mine has a saying about creating a company. "Trying to build a company and have it succeed is like eating glass and staring into the abyss".  
After starting a company, it might be quite exciting initially, but then later on, reality sets in and challenges begin to show up. I'll advise anyone who wishes to start a company to have a high pain tolerance.  

**2. Master Computer Skills - Jordan Peterson**  
If I had children now, I'd make sure that they knew how to use the computer and how to program. If you're smart and you can use a computer, you're so much smarter than you would have been if you were only just smart.  
Expert computer users are so powerful.

**3. Become a Learning Machine - Tony Robbins**  
The one breakthrough for all leaders is constant never-ending-improvement which means educating yourself and continuing to develop. The opportunity for self education is there. Instead of complaining, you need to say to yourself: "Where are the skill sets valued in the marketplace and how do I work harder on myself, because if I become more valuable, then I'll be able to do more, give more and change more".

**4. Influence and persuade people - Ed Mylett**  
If I could go back and you could only give me one skill to begin with and I had to build from all of it, then it would be the ability to influence, the ability to persuade people. Without that skillset the vast majority of my wealth does not exist. If you can't persuade people, if you can't influence people to make decisions that are in their own best interest but that also grow your business, your brand, your company, your networth, etc, then you can't be successful. One thing that everybody I know that is a leader in evrything they do can do is persuade people. Some do it through intimidation, force, humour, persuasive strategy, transferred energy, but all leaders and successful people know how to influence people.  
The fact of the matter is **You've got to become a better persuader.**

**5. Have Integrity - Warren Buffet**  
It takes 3 qualities essentially to do well. It takes Intelligence, Energy and Integrity. We'd rather hire someone that is dumb and lazy but has integrity than hire someone that has intelligence and energy but lacks integrity.  
Integrity is an option. You may not be able to do some things but you can choose where you stand on the integrity scale.
