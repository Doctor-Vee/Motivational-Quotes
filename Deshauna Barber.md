## Deshauna Barber's Speech
At times, our purpose drops in our laps as if the heavens threw it by accident. 
I ask only one thing of you all today after you leave this building. **Do not fear failure but please be terrified of regret.**
Giving up is the birth of regret... 

What I ask of you today is to not take NO for an answer.

**Don't be afraid of NOs. Be afraid of the possibility of a YES that you have prematurely destroyed because you decided to quit before the clock strikes 12.**

*Telling me NO is like adding fuel to a fire that is now set ablaze because of your single NO.* So, today, I challenge you to fight, to work, to not stop here, to believe so heavily in your aspirations that you too will not fear the word NO, but instead, you will choose to welcome it.     - **Deshauna Barber**



### Additional Note
Sometimes, we tend to give up or probably refuse to even try out something because of fear that we might fail, or that we might be rejected but then, sometimes you just need to give yourself a chance. You'll discover that you'll do far better than you imagined in your head before you gave that thing a shot. Sometimes, we tend to underestimate our abilities and tend to limit ourselves because of fear of failure/rejection. Rise up today and get that thing done! You've thought about it and waited long enough... Now, go take action! Even if you get rejected, even if you fail, do not take NO for an answer... You gotta keep pushing!!! ***JUST DO~~N'T~~ ~~QU~~IT***
