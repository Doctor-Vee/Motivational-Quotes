## 5 Pieces of Life-Changing Advice from Robert Kiyosaki

**1. Always Be A Student**  
I spend most of my time with entrepreneurs. I don't spend my time with people who complain about the economy.

**2. Give A Lot**  
It goes to the Biblical Principle; The more you give, the more you receive. When I meet somebody who doesn't have any money, It just means they're not giving something. 
A lot of times, there are people who would like more but they're not giving anything. If you wanna get paid more, work more, give more. That's how I see it.

**3. Hang Out With The Best**  
If you wanna stay small, be the smartest guy on the block. In the military, we were taught to be generalists not specialists. 
I don't have to be the best but I have to hangout with the best.

**4. Master Sales**  
The number one skill of an entrepreneur is the ability to sell, to communicate. 
It's not just selling to your customers alone; you gotta sell to your employees, your investors and yourself. You need PR and marketing after which sales will come easily.

**5. Learn through Trial and Error**  
I've had bad teachers as well as good teachers... That's part of real life. There no real answer as to how to make money. It's trial and error. It's learning. You gotta make mistakes. 
My mistakes have been very good for me because I've learnt from them.

**Be A Team Player**  
Games are the best teaching tools. My rich dad taught me to be a rich man playing monopoly. The formula for great wealth in monopoly is 4 green houses and 1 red hotel. 
So, today in Arizona, I own 8000 green houses and several red hotels. I just played monopoly for real. That's the power of a game because a game engages me mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.  
One guy cannot take on a team. Business is the same thing ... Business is a team sport. I have to have great staff and great leaders. The trouble with most entrepreneurs is that they're self employed.  
All I focus on is putting the best team together. I don't want to be the smartest guy on my team but I want to have the best team. And that's why I win most of my games.
