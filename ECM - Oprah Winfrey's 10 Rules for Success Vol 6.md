## Oprah Winfrey's 10 Rules for Success Vol 6

**1. Focus on Service**  
Everybody has a different talent and the reason we're all so messed up is because you're looking at every body else's talent and wishing you had some of their talent. 
All the energy you spend being envious and jealous of somebody else is not only energy that you're taking away from you but also energy that you're putting out which will come back negatively. 
All your energy should be focused on "What do I have to offer?", "What do I have to give?", "How can I be used in service?" 
From Dr Martin Luther King's message, "Not everybody can be famous but everybody can be great because greatness is determined by service"
No matter your profession or field you can make your job more fulfilling by switching the paradigm to service. 
You should ask yourself "How do I use this in service to something bigger than myself?" At that point, it no longer becomes a job, it becomes an offering to the world.

**2. Use Every Experience**  
This is the beauty of my life. There is not a thing that happens to me that I don't look at as a teaching/learning experience and so whenever I go into any kind of crisis, I'm always looking for what it will teach me.

**3. Be A Great Reader**  
Reading is the strongest signal for success in the future that I've ever seen. When you are a great reader, you can articulate and speak and command the English language in ways that other people cannot and people will think you're a lot smarter than you are.

**4. Fill your Cup**  
There is not one thing that has ever happened to you that hasn't happened just to make you better and help you rise. You need something that gives back and nourishes you. 
You need to fill your cup that you can be so full that your cup runneth over and you can have enough to give to other people. 
If you don't fill your cup, you end up dried up, tired, exhausted and not having enough to give to other people. You become resentful when anybody asks you because your cup is empty and now they want some of yours. 
Your number one job is to fill your cup and make yourself whole.

**5. Build Trust**  
In order to do the stuff, money is important. There is nothing more important to me than having the trust of the people and the audience.

**6. Get in Sync with Life**  
Everything that goes out is coming back. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Everything you do to someone is coming back to you. 
Meditation syncs you up with the source. It allows you to literally tap into the power that created you so that you are in alignment with that and everything you do comes from the centre of that alignment that is coming from the Source (God). 
When you are synced up with life, life just gives to you.

**7. Set Boundaries**  
When I first started making money, I was one of those people who would tend to go crazy about what to do. 
You have to look within yourself and decide what you want to do because before you know it you start realising that you have a lot of family members and cousins. 
I've given away so much that people don't know because most of the time, you don't hear about people that I help. 
Sometimes, people complain about what I did or didn't do. "Y'all don't know me". I have all of that very much in check.

**8. Be Open and Vulnerable**  
There is no story that anybody has ever heard that somebody else hasn't experienced. 
All pain is the same and the common denominator in the human experience is our emotions and our feelings and the more vulnerable and open you're willing to be with your story, the more actual understanding you create with other people and the more powerful you become.
People don't think less of you for sharing your story. They think more of you for having the courage to share it.

**9. Relax**  
What I would say to my younger self is "Relax", "Stop being afraid", "Everything is gonna be alright, no matter what, you're gonna be okay"

**10 . Surprise your fans**  
*Oprah Winfrey surprised one of her fans by showing up while she was being interviewed on the Ellen show.*

**Aim for Excellence - Oprah Winfrey**  
I heard Jesse Jackson speak when I was a kid and he said that Excellence is the best deterrent to racism and sexism and that really became my model. 
In the third grade, I was one of those kids that made other kids sick because I was the first one to turn in the book report and the one that read the most books.
