## 6 Best Lessons From Billionaire Entrepreneurs

**1. Don't Be Afraid To Fail - Jeff Bezos**  
Getting it wrong isn't that bad. The big winners pay for thousands of failed experiments.

**2. Don't Rely on Wishful Thinking - Elon Musk**  
I'd recommend studying the thinking process around Physics. Always take the position that you're some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong over time.  
One of the biggest **mistakes** people make and I'm guilty of it too is **Wishful thinking.** You want something to be true even if it isn't true and so you ignore the real truth because of what you want to be true.
Listen to honest feedback from friends. 

**3. Have a Competitive Advantage - Warren Buffet**  
If you have a really good product that people really love, an increase in price will be immaterial to them.

**4. Change Your Thinking - Jack Ma**  
In the past, everyone wanted to be the big or powerful company ... the bigger the better. In this century, A good company is more important than a powerful company.  
No matter how strong an elephant is, if you're an ant, if you hide yourself well, an elephant cannot kill you. You can kill the elephant if you're in a better position.  
It's about your thinking.

**5. Set Boundaries - Oprah Winfrey**  
When I first started making money, I was one of those people who would tend to go crazy about what to do. You have to look within yourself and decide what you want to do because before you know it you start realising that you have a lot of family members and cousins.
I've given away so much that people don't know because most of the time, you don't hear about people that I help. 
Sometimes, people complain about what I did or didn't do. "Y'all don't know me".  I have all of that very much in check.

**6. Study Success - Mark Zuckerberg**  
A lot of the early lessons that I took on how to think about strategy came from Peter and Sean. Also, I did pay a lot of attention to Microsoft when I was growing up. 
The way they built a platform inspired me that maybe one day, the tools that I'm building can be part of a broader ecosystem as well.

**Be An Eagle - John Paul DeJoria**  
When God created this planet, He created several species. He created a perfect social economic world where everything was free and you didn't have to worry about a thing. Everything was taken care of. 
The oyster for instance had food, shelter(it's shell), protection and everything it needed but was placed at the bottom of the sea. The eagle on the other hand was allowed to roam around but it had to source for everything it needed on its own (food, shelter, etc). 
The eagle flies through miles in the winter time, rain, snow, etc just to feed its young. 
The eagle fails 95% of the time because many times, when it comes to feed on its prey, because of its size, it's easily detected and its prey run off in different directions. 5% of the time, it succeeds yet it has succeeded to be the strongest bird in the sky.
Now, the eagle unlike the oyster can go anywhere it wants. The eagle, not the oyster is the emblem of America and is also on the flag of many many countries.  
**Don't only imagine. Start doing it.**
