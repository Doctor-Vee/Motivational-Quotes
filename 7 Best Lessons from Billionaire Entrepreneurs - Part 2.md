## 7 Best Lessons from Billionaire Entrepreneurs - Part 2

**1. Be Open & Vulnerable - Oprah Winfrey**  
There is no story that anybocy has ever heard that somebody else hasn't experienced. All pain is the same and the common denominator in the human experience is our emotions and our feelings and the more vulnerable and open you're willing to be with your story, the more actual understanding you create with other people and the more powerful you become.  
People don't think less of you for sharing your story. They think more of you for having the courage to share it.

**2. Take Risks - Elon Musk**  
The first 3 rockets we launched in SpaceX failed and I only had enough money for 3 flights. The team rallied round and we were able to put together enough spare parts to create the 4th one which was eventually successful.

**3. Delight the Customers - Jeff Bezos**  
Don't be afraid of your competitors no matter how big they are. Be focused on your customers, rather than obsessing over your competitors. Stay focused on your customers and no matter what the drama or external distraction is, your response should be to double down on the customers, satisfy and delight them.

**4. Get Used to Being Rejected - Jack Ma**  
Get used to getting NO from people. Don't expect help from people.

**5. Invest In What You Do Best - Bill Gates**  
We're a software company. What we do well, what we love, what we know is building great software.

**6. Don't Dwell on Mistakes - Warren Buffet**  
There are a lot of games I've missed. I don't worry about the things I miss that are outside my circle of confidence. 

**7. Build A Team - Mark Zuckerberg**  
There's a little bit of this cultural bias that one person does this. People say that I built Facebook, or Steve Jobs built Apple, etc. That's really not true. We're people, we helped but there are thousands and thousands of other people who were involved in building these things. 
The reality is that as strong as any one individual is, no one person can deal with all the challenges that are gonna get thrown at them.  
One of the ways I think we can maintain resilience is by having cofounders and partners who complement our strengths and fortify our weaknesses and kinda encourage us and give us a push to keep going when things are tough.
There's actually a lot of data on this that Companies that get started with more cofounders are more likely to be successful.
