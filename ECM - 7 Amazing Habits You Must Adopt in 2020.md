## 7 Amazing Habits You Must Adopt in 2020

**1. Journal - David Goggins**  
Having a daily journal helps me figure out where I'm messing up and areas I need to fix.

**2. Use the "Do It Anyway" Strategy - Mel Robbins**  
Many times we decide that we want to do something and when the time comes, we don't feel like it and we end up not doing that thing.
When we adopt the "Do It Anyway" strategy, we make ourselves do the things we need to do even when we don't feel like doing them.

**3. Workout - Manny Khoshbin**  
Workout makes you feel great. It not only improves your physique, it also improves your mind. It helps you focus.

**4. Become A Great Reader - Oprah Winfrey**  
Reading is the strongest signal for success. When you are a great reader, you can articulate, speak and command the English language in ways that other people cannot. That makes people think that you're a lot smarter than you are

**5. Beat the Sun Up - Grant Cardone**  
Many people say complain about how much time they have... Many of them don't have time because they don't beat the sun up. Get started early.

**6. Push yourself - Dan Lok**  
Take a moment and imagine that you all the things that you currently have in your life. Also imagine the things that you wish to have but don't currently have.
Everything you have currently are things that are within your comfort zone and your comfort zone is more or less your income zone. The things you don't have are outside your comfort zone.
In order to get what you want but don't have in life, you have to stretch or expand your comfort zone.  
I believe that the number one habit that you need to be successful is to **do things that make you feel uncomfortable on a daily basis.**  
What holds most people back is fear... fear of the unknown, fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of success.  
Human beings, because we're a creature of habits, we tend to operate day to day doing the same things again and again and again but if you make it a habit that you do things on a consistent basis that you don't usually do, things that scare you, things that make you stretch your comfort zone, that's how you expand your comfort zone and get more of what you want. 
It may be: going to an event that you've never been to, meeting successful people that intimidate you, reading a book that you have no interest in, etc.  
Try to do that, not one time, nor two times, but hundreds of times on a consistent basis and you'll find out that you have gotten a habit that not only helps you become successful but helps you stay successful.

**7. Mix with Successful People - Bob Proctor**  
You cannot mix with people that are going nowhere and expect that you're going somewhere.
