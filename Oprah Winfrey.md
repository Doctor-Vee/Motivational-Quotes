## Oprah Winfrey's MasterClass

In this world, there are a lot of things that are beyond our control, but what you do have control over is how you react to whatever happens in your life.
What I now know is that we all become exactly what we believe.

My confidence comes from knowing that there is something greater than myself, that I am a part of and is also a part of me. 
I call that GOD but I do nothing without that understanding.
Not understanding that puts you at your own pitiful, meagre, little will and everything is left up to you. 
You cannot survive in this world by yourself, just believing in yourself. 
You're not big enough to do it, I'm not big enough to do it, nobody is big enough to do it.
**You have to understand that your presence here as a human being on earth came from something greater than you.**

The fact that you're here matters. This is no accident. None of us are. 
Always do your best and doing your best always puts you at the next level.
Luck is preparation meeting the moment of opportunity.
Everything that has happened in your life is preparing you for the moment that is to come.

If you don't know your purpose, the first thing is to figure that out.

Life is about growth and change.

**The way you step up your game is not to worry about the other guy in any situation, because you can't control the other guy. 
You only have control over yourself.**

You gotta take responsibility for the space you hold here. 

How far you are from the connection to Source Energy, That which created you is how out of sync you are with your life. 
When you can align with that, nobody can touch you.

**When your personality comes to serve the energy of your soul, that is authentic power.** - *(Excerpt from Seat of the soul by **Gary Zukav**)*

What is real and what is lasting is who you are and what you were meant to bring
