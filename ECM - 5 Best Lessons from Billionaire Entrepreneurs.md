## 5 Best Lessons from Billionaire Entrepreneurs

**1. Act Despite Fear - Elon Musk**  
There are just times when something is important enough and you believe in it enough that you do it in spite of fear. 
It's normal to feel fear.

**2. Get in Sync with Life - Oprah Winfrey**  
Everything that goes out is coming back. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Everything you do to someone is coming back to you.
Meditation syncs you up with the source. It allows you to literally tap into the power that created you so that you are in alignment with that and everything you do comes from the centre of that alignment that is coming from the Source (God).
When you are synced up with life, life just gives to you.

**3. Go Step by Step - Jeff Bezos**  
You may not have everything figured out. Just put one foot in front of the other. Proceed adaptively, step by step.
When you have a success, you double down on that success and figure out what else you can do and what customers want

**4. Prove your worth - Jack Ma**  
You can convince people when your solution/idea works. The two most important set of people you need to convince are your team and your customers. You may need to convince your investors too.

**5. Turn Failure into a Plus - Warren Buffet**  
You may get some disappointments but, the future is what counts. If I knew every decision I was going to make was perfect, it would not be fun. Mistakes are part of the game. We make plenty of mistakes in business.
