## Best Advice for Young People

**1. Take Risks - Gary Vaynerchuk**  
I'm not sure anybody is taking enough risk from 20 to 30. Many people instead become conservative and try to use this period of their lives to prove something to their parents to themselves. 
Everybody between 20 to 30 should go out there and do a ton of ridiculous sh** and figure themselves out on their own dime, not their parents'

**2. Ask the Right Questions - Elon Musk**  
Very often, the issue is understanding what questions to ask and if you can properly frame the questions, the answer is the easy part.

**3. Sacrifice - Jorday Peterson**  
In childhood you're nothing but potential but it's not realised and you don't know how realise it and for you to realise your potential, you have to sacrifice almost all of it to a single direction.
Also, the thing about growing up is that you sacrifice everything you could have been as a child to be the one thing that you're aiming at. 

**4. Find your Passion - Michelle Obama**  
I didn't find my passion until long after college. I spent time in school chasing grades, checking boxes, climbing higher and higher, etc. In my mid 20s, I had everything I was told I should want: a fancy job, a big office, a nice paycheck, etc but on the inside, something was missing.
I finally asked myself some big questions, simple questions: "What did I want out of my life?", "What makes me happy?", "What do I care about?"
Soon, I realised that what I really wanted was pretty simple. I wanted to give back to the people around me, to the world around me. I wanted to live my life by the principle "To whom much is given, much is expected"
That led me to quit that fancy job and since then, I've dedicated my life to giving back.
Do not waste a minute living someone else's dream. Each of us has unique gifts but it takes a lot of work, a lot a real work to discover what brings you joy. It just doesn't happen. It requires you spending some time and you won't find what you love simply by checking boxes or padding your GPA. 
You won't figure it out only by listening to your guidance counselor, your friends or even your parents.  
You can only find your passion by looking inside yourself.

**5. Work Super Hard - Bill Gates**  
From my particular make-up, it really is true that I didn't believe in weekends and vacations. I knew everybody's license plate and I could tell over the last month when their cars had come and gone from the parking lot. I have a fairly hard core view that there should be a very large sacrifice made during those early years.

**Do What You Love - Andrew Yang**  
What I say to young people is this "It's really important to find something that you enjoy and like because if you enjoy it, then you're more likely to invest time in it and become good at it and develop skills that are resilient over time. 
So, believe it or not, if you're a young person, if you find something that you enjoy doing, you should lean into that and a lot of that revolves around interpersonal dynamics and skills because team building is going to become crucial over time in a world where dealing with people is going to become a massive value add.
If you can find something that you like doing, just really try and get good at it.
