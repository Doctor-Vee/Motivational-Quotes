## Bob Proctor's 50 Rules for Success

**1. Discover Your Purpose**  
I don't think you determine what your purpose is, you discover it. Determining your purpose means deciding what it should be but then, you should discover it, not decide it. Your purpose is your reason for living.  
Ask yourself, what do I really love doing? If I was to spend my entire life doing something, what would that thing be?

**2. Don't Waste Your Minutes**  
Sometimes, people come to you and say "Have you got a minute?" The past is gone and you don't know how much time you've got left in the future. What you have to deal with is the present.  
People who win are people who make up their minds that they're not going to waste the minutes. They're gonna be productive. They're gonna make it happen every minute.

**3. Stand Out**  
Success is the realisation of a worthy ideal. Anyone that has a goal and is moving towards it is successful. Most people think you're successful only when you have a lot of money.  
One of the barriers to success is our conditioning; a conditioning that takes place in our subconcious mind from the time we are infants. 
Another barrier is our environment. We tend to act and talk like the people around us. We should make a few waves. We should stand out. Be different not for the sake of being different but because we are different and we all think different thoughts.  
I believe we should start to think and build images in our mind of what we'd like to do and start to do it. Emerson, Edison, etc did that. They were different. They stood out. They made a few waves.

**4. Seek Failures**  
If you're playing it safe, you're not gonna win. It's by trying things that you figure out how far you can go. You've got to get outside the box.  
Rather than dwelling on his failures, Edison chose to see his failures and different steps to creating a light bulb.  
I treat winning and losing exactly the same way. I do not let it upset me. If I am into an idea, the idea of losing never enters my mind.
If you're not prepared to lose, you're never gonna win because you're always playing it safe and there's no reward in that.

**5. Conquer Your Own Limitations**  
On 29 May 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. Before they climbed, they didn't know how to get to the top of the mountain.  
That's what stops most people; the fact that they don't know how. After these two men got to the top of Mount Everest, over a thousand people have climbed that mountain.  
A young woman was interviewed after she had returned from going to the top of Mount Everest and a reporter asked her how she felt after conquering the mountain and she said "We didn't conquer the mountain, that mountain can't be conquered. We conquered the limitations that are within ourselves."

**6. Go to Experts for Advice**  
Select a person who is already doing something that you'd like to do. Get to know that person. Go to the experts for advice. Don't ask the person next door, your mother or father, etc because they don't necessarily know. There's no point asking someone how to make a lot of money if the person is not earning much himself. If he knew, he'd be probably earning a lot. Read relevant books over and over again. When you read a good book through the second time, you don't see something in it that you didn't see before, you see something in yourself that wasn't there before.

**7. Don't Worry About What Others Think of You**  
Think of the amount of time that is wasted on negative energy wondering what other people think of you. What they think of you really doesn't make any difference. It's what you think of you that makes the difference. So, as you go through the day, don't worry about what other people think of you. Just say "I'm alright, I'm God's highest form of creation

**8. Crash through the Terror Barrier**  
Freedom is on the other side of the terror barrier and only very few people get through that terror barrier. Freedom is available to everyone. There isn't anyone that could not live the way they want to live. Fear causes people to stay where they are even when they feel like changing jobs, relocating, etc. Even if you hit the terror barrier, you've got to keep pushing. Crossing the terror barrier is going beyond where you're at into a new level. When you set a goal, if it doesn't scare and excite you at the same time, then you might be going in the wrong direction. *"The Cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek" - **Joseph Campbell***  

**9. Develop your Imagination**  
Many years ago, I read where Napoleon Hill pointed that the imagination is the most marvelous, miraculous, inconceivably powerful force that the world has ever known. The average individual uses their imagination (if they use it at all) against themselves. They imagine what they don't want. They imagine problems coming. Let's begin to use our imaginations the way God meant them to be used. It's the greatest faculty that we possess and we can build anything we want with it. Look around you and observe all the things that have been created and invented which did not exist before. Everyone of them was first created in the mind of one individual through imagination. You can use your imagination to go into the future and bring it into the present. That's what highly successful people do. They see where they want to go and then they act like the person they want to become. Don't let your present results hinder you from imagining what you want and it's with your imagination that you will build it. Only about 2 to 3 % of the population properly use their imagination. It's almost inconceivable that people would wander around with so much power and potential and squander it.  
**Everyone is creative and no one is more creative than another. It's just that some have chosen to use their creative faculties to a greater degree than others.**  
Make certain that you exercise your imagination daily. Build beautiful images in your mind of how you want to live, hold those pictures there and then live that way. If you keep your imagination alive and active, you'll have a phenomenal life. Life can get better everyday and it will get better everyday through proper use of your imagination. What a wonderful ideal.

**10. Change the Paradigm**  
It's the thoughts that you think that control the vibration you're in and that dictates what you attract. People that are in a poverty consciousness continue to attract lack and limitation. Most times, we don't like to do things differently because it causes us a lot of discomfort. You've got to change the vibration you're in and your whole world changes. When you change the paradigm, the change in results is automatic. You'll never attract to you wealth, happiness, health, etc until you get the paradigm to get you on that frequency. Program in positive information and eliminate negative ones. Start to think of what you're grateful for.
