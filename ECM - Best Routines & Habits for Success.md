## Best Routines and Habits for Success 

**1. Sleep More and Meditate - Kobe Bryant**  
Get additional 30 minutes of sleep at night.  
Start with just 5 minutes of meditation each day. Just sit and find that inner voice. Listen to yourself... preferably in the morning. 
I meditate every morning for about 10 to 15 minutes and it sets me up for the rest of the day ... It's like having an anchor. 
If I don't do it, I feel like I'm chasing the day rather than feeling like I'm in control of the day. For me it's really just listening to my inner self ... I basically just allow the thoughts to come forward.
Many times, we're constantly observing and paying attention to everything that surrounds us but we don't take the time to observe what is going on inside of ourselves.

**2. Get Rid of your phone - Mel Robbins**  
I do not allow my phone in the bedroom. Put your phone away from you when you're about to sleep. 
When you allow yourself to become a tool to your phone instead of your phone being your tool, then there is a problem. You should have control over your phone.

**3. Use the 20/20/20 formula - Robin Sharma**  
If you start your day with sweaty exercise, you're actually going to activate a pharmacy of mastery that exists in every human brain.
It will accelerate your processing, repair brain cells that have been damaged by stress, etc. 
Rise at 5am. Many of the great people we know today usually get up at 5am. Before the sun rises is the time of least distraction. 
This is also when you can build intimacy and fluency with what you wanna stand for in your day.
**The 20/20/20 rule is this:**  
5:00 - 5:20 - **Move.** Get into the sweaty exercise and this gives you more energy and joy and helps you accelerate your focus.   
5:20 - 5:40 - **Reflect.** We live in a world where a lot of people are so busy climbing the wrong Mount Everest. Clarity is one of the DNAs of Mastery. Use these 20 minutes to meditate, visualise or you just sit in solitude and think and ponder and reflect.
5:40 - 6:00 - **Grow.** If you look at the greatest billionaires and producers on the planet, they have one thing in common. They are ridiculously curious, no matter how much money they make or impact they have. One of the keys to epic performance is a relentless commitment to daily growth.
You've got to get those mornings calibrated if you really wanna win.
