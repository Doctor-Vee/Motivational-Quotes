## Deshauna Barber's Speech
At times, our purpose drops in our laps as if the heavens threw it by accident. 
I ask only one thing of you all today after you leave this building. **Do not fear failure but please be terrified of regret.**
Giving up is the birth of regret... 

What I ask of you today is to not take NO for an answer.

**Don't be afraid of NOs. Be afraid of the possibility of a YES that you have prematurely destroyed because you decided to quit before the clock strikes 12.**

*Telling me NO is like adding fuel to a fire that is now set ablaze because of your single NO.* So, today, I challenge you to fight, to work, to not stop here, to believe so heavily in your aspirations that you too will not fear the word NO, but instead, you will choose to welcome it.
