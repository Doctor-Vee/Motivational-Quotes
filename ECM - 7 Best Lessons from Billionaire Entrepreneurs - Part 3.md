## 7 Best Lessons from Billionaire Entrepreneurs - Part 3

**1. Work Hard - Bill Gates**  

**2. Be a Great Reader - Oprah Winfrey**  
Reading is the strongest signal for success in the future that I've ever seen. When you are a great reader, you can articulate and speak and command the English language in ways that other people cannot and people will think you're a lot smarter than you are.

**3. Use Physics principles in your thinking - Elon Musk**  
The way I tend to view problems is from a Physics standpoint. One of the key things in Physics is to reason from first principles and this is contrary to the way most human reasoning takes place which is by analogy. Reasoning from first principles just means that you figure out what the fundamental truths are, things that people are pretty sure of. If you come up with an idea and it tends to violate one of those truths, then you're probably wrong or you should get a really big prize. 
Reasoning by analogy is helpful because it's a shortcut and is mostly correct but it tends to be incorrect when you're dealing with new things because it's hard to analogise to something really new.

**4. Follow your dreams - Jack Ma**  
In my apartment, when we started, we aimed high, we had a dream. We said we wanted to become one of the top ten internet companies in the world. We wanted to make this company last for up to a hundred years yet we didn't know where our pay would come from the next month. Whether you're poor or not, if you have good dreams, you cannot be poor. 

**5. Be Resourceful - Jeff Bezos**  
Every summer since when I was 4, I had to be with my grandparents on their ranch in Texas. Everyday, I went to the ranch with my grandfather to "help". My grandfather was so resourceful that he made his own veterinary needles. At some point, he bought a used caterpillar bulldozer which was broken and the gears were stripped. We spent a whole summer repairing that. We had to build his own crane to take the gears out of the transmission. What I learned from watching him was just how resourceful he was. He didn't ever call repairmen. He always figured things out.

**6. Have the right heroes - Warren Buffet**  
If you tell me who your heroes are, I can tell you how you're gonna turn out to quite an extent by this point in life. When you go through a tough time in life, having the right heroes will take you through it.

**7. Do Good - Mark Zuckerberg**  
I really do believe that if you do something good and if you help people out, then, eventually some portion of that good will come back to you. You may not know upfront what it's gonna be but that's just been the guiding principle for me and the work that we've done.

**Find your path - Mark Cuban**  
My parents used to make me work odd jobs so that I would learn the value of work. As I was working all these jobs, I always thought within myself that this was just not me and I always had that individual spirit to say that I could come up with things that could make me money. When I was 9, I sold baseball cards. When I was 12, I sold boxes of garbage bags from door to door because I wanted to buy baseball shoes. All that just gave me confidence and it took off from there.
