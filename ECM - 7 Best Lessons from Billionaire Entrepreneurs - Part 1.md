## 7 Best Lessons from Billionaire Entrepreneurs - Part 1

**1. Don't Fear Fear Too Much - Elon Musk**  
If you studied Engineering and figured out how to design new things, then it's relatively easy to start a company. You just need to get a few like minded people with you and focus on creating a prototype as soon as possible which you can take to Venture Capitalists and Investors.
You may try a couple of times and may or may not succeed. I think sometimes, people fear starting a company too much.

**2. Fill Your Cup - Oprah Winfrey**  
There is not one thing that has ever happened to you that hasn't happened just to make you better and help you rise. 
You need something that gives back and nourishes you. You need to fill your cup that you can be so full that your cup runneth over and you can have enough to give to other people. If you don't fill your cup, you end up dried up, tired, exhausted and not having enough to give to other people. You become resentful when anybody asks you because your cup is empty and now they want some of yours. 
Your number one job is to fill your cup and make yourself whole.

**3. Do What You Love - Warren Buffet**  
I get to do what I like to do every single day of the year and I get to do it with people I like. I would advise you to go to work for an organisation that you admire, people that you admire because it will turn you on. You ought to be happy where you're working.  
Get right into what you enjoy. You'll be successful at it. You won't be able to miss. 
I don't regard what I do as the most important think in the world but it's right for me. 

**4. Experiment More - Jeff Bezos**  
You cannot invent in pioneer if you cannot accept failure. To invent, you need to experiment. If you know in advance that it's going to work, it is not an experiment. Failure and invention are inseparable twins. It's embarrasing to fail but the truth is, the time you succeed can be highly rewarding. The payoff can be very asymmetric which is why you should do so much experimentation.  
The success of baseball is capped at 4 runs but in business, every once in a while, you step up your play and you hit the ball so hard that you can get a thousand runs. This encourages you to experiment more.  
It's the right business decision to experiment more and it's also better for your customers.

**5. Get Used to Being Challenged - Jack Ma**  
People like us are used to criticisms. We're used to getting NOs from people. As an entrepreneur, you have to get used to being challenged.

**6. Be Courageous - Sara Blakely**  
 It's a risk to invent something. You have to risk being made fun of. You have to risk looking like an idiot. You have to do something that didn't already exist which is scary. 

**7. Learn from History - Mark Cuban**  
Find businesses that relate to what you want to do who have tried and failed in the past and learn from those. You've got to understand all the implications. You've got to find out the history of people who have tried your idea because there's 99.999% chance that your idea has been tried before. That's not a good reason not to start it because you might be able to outperform them, but you better learn from the history of your idea.

**Build A Good Team - Mark Zuckerberg**  
Companies are not about any one person and aren't about any two people either. Companies that work best are the ones that have people with different strengths who complement each other. A huge part of the success of Facebook and our ability to grow the community have been because of the partnership we've built and a number of other really special people here who have different skills and are not afraid to challenge one another and bring their voices to the table and I think that's a special thing.
