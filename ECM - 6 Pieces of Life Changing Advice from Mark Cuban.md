## 6 Pieces of Life Changing Advice from Mark Cuban

**1. Be Nice**  
"Nice" is way undervalued. Be Nice. It just makes life so much easier. The nicer I got, the more effective people around me got, the more productive they got, the more sales we had.  
We all get that feeling of tenseness and stress at various points in time that we all have to go through, but sometimes, you just have to calm, take a deep breath and be nice.  
If you reduce the stress of people and you're nice, you're gonna have such a huge advantage, no matter what your technology is. Your culture will come through.

**2. Take Risks**  
Sometimes, we feel comfortable with our current situation and may not be willing to take a risk especially if it can affect what we currently have. 

**3. Outwork Everyone**  
Most people do a lot of talking and don't put in the effort. There's nothing you can't accomplish in life with the right amount of work. The challenge is "Are you willing to do the work?" but the reality is... Most people aren't. But that's the opportunity.  

**4. Be Brutally Honest with Yourself**  
One of the big things that most startups do is that they lie to themselves, over and over and over; "Mine's faster", "mine's cheaper", "mine's better", etc.  
You've gotta be very careful as an entrepreneur to be brutally honest with yourself. Know what you know and know what you don't know, but you gotta know your business better than anybody.  

**5. Be Prepared to Win**  
The hardest part of starting a business is taking that first step. My attitude to business has always been "If you're prepared, it's not a risk". Bobby Knight usually says *"Everybody's got a will to win but it's only those with a will to prepare that do win"* and the same applies to business.  
It's not just always about passion or the idea, it's also about "Are you prepared and are you willing to do the work?"

**6. Try Out Different Things**  
You just have to try different things and even if 99% of them fail, you only have to be right one time. You don't have to figure it all out in advance.
You can be wrong many times but if you get right one time, you're set. But if you don't try and if you don't go out there and try **all** those different things, you'll not get that one time.  
Try 'em all until you find the one you like and then it gets really easy because even when things don't work out the way you expect, you don't give up because you're on a mission and you love what you do.

**Always Be A Student - Mark Cuban**  
You have to have more than just a cursory understanding of AI and other things related to tech today because AI will change everything we do.  
Don't think to yourself "I'm not tactful enough, or I'm not gonna get this, it's too much" ... Try it. Get as far as you can because it will make you more confident.
