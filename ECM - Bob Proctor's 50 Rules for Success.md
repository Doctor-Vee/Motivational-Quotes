## Bob Proctor's 50 Rules for Success

**1. Discover Your Purpose**  
I don't think you determine what your purpose is, you discover it. Determining your purpose means deciding what it should be but then, you should discover it, not decide it. Your purpose is your reason for living.  
Ask yourself, what do I really love doing? If I was to spend my entire life doing something, what would that thing be?

**2. Don't Waste Your Minutes**  
Sometimes, people come to you and say "Have you got a minute?" The past is gone and you don't know how much time you've got left in the future. What you have to deal with is the present.  
People who win are people who make up their minds that they're not going to waste the minutes. They're gonna be productive. They're gonna make it happen every minute.

**3. Stand Out**  
Success is the realisation of a worthy ideal. Anyone that has a goal and is moving towards it is successful. Most people think you're successful only when you have a lot of money.  
One of the barriers to success is our conditioning; a conditioning that takes place in our subconcious mind from the time we are infants. 
Another barrier is our environment. We tend to act and talk like the people around us. We should make a few waves. We should stand out. Be different not for the sake of being different but because we are different and we all think different thoughts.  
I believe we should start to think and build images in our mind of what we'd like to do and start to do it. Emerson, Edison, etc did that. They were different. They stood out. They made a few waves.

**4. Seek Failures**  
If you're playing it safe, you're not gonna win. It's by trying things that you figure out how far you can go. You've got to get outside the box.  
Rather than dwelling on his failures, Edison chose to see his failures and different steps to creating a light bulb.  
I treat winning and losing exactly the same way. I do not let it upset me. If I am into an idea, the idea of losing never enters my mind.
If you're not prepared to lose, you're never gonna win because you're always playing it safe and there's no reward in that.

**5. Conquer Your Own Limitations**  
On 29 May 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. Before they climbed, they didn't know how to get to the top of the mountain.  
That's what stops most people; the fact that they don't know how. After these two men got to the top of Mount Everest, over a thousand people have climbed that mountain.  
A young woman was interviewed after she had returned from going to the top of Mount Everest and a reporter asked her how she felt after conquering the mountain and she said "We didn't conquer the mountain, that mountain can't be conquered. We conquered the limitations that are within ourselves."
